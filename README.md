My webdevelopment learning process

# Day 1 - 20.04.2020
Woohoo, here we go!
HTML structure set up, some essential CSS code added. First JS script written - a clock with the current date.

# Day 3 - 22.04.2020
New JS script added - a slideshow with tank pictures. Not working, sadly.

# Day 5 - 24.04.2020
Tank slideshow still not operational. First attempt to set up a localhost server using XAMPP and implement some simple php code.
Server set up and working without any fatal issues. PHP script working sound.

# Day 6 - 25.04.2020
Slideshow working thanks to a kind soul. 

# Day 13 - 07.05.2020
I started working with Github Desktop and since I do not know it very well I just recently have found out that none of the stuff put in there is published on the website.
The site had to be rewritten due to a serious issue related with CSS specificity and div naming. I find it good, though - I started to feel stuck with the previous one. It took me three days to put together the website as it is now.
