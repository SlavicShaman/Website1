# Website1
My webdevelopment learning process

# Day 1 - 20.04.2020
Woohoo, here we go!
HTML structure set up, some essential CSS code added. First JS script written - a clock with the current date.

# Day 3 - 22.04.2020
New JS script added - a slideshow with tank pictures. Not working, sadly.

# Day 5 - 24.04.2020
Tank slideshow still not operational. First attempt to set up a localhost server using XAMPP and implement some simple php code.
Server set up and working without any fatal issues. PHP script working sound.

# Day 6 - 25.04.2020
Slideshow working thanks to a kind soul. 

# Day 7 - 01.05.2020
I realised that the site was broken. In case of changing anything related to body tag in CSS, the site looked horribly. I am going to write it all over again.

# Day 9 - 03.05.2020
Uploading a new version of the website. The previous, broken one is moved to trash repository, folder broken-prototype-Website1-version1.
