# Website1
My webdevelopment learning process

# Day 1 - 20.04.2020
Woohoo, here we go!
HTML structure set up, some essential CSS code added. First JS script written - a clock with the current date.

# Day 3 - 22.04.2020
New JS script added - a slideshow with tank pictures. Not working, sadly.

# Day 5 - 24.04.2020
Tank slideshow still not operational. First attempt to set up a localhost server using XAMPP and implement some simple php code.
Server set up and working without any fatal issues. PHP script working sound.

# Day 6 - 25.04.2020
Slideshow working thanks to a kind soul. 

# Day 13  - 08.05.2020
I decided that the website has to be rewritten from a scratch. Now it has been moved to the ,,trash" repository.
I've decided that the new website will be an online newspaper. Now it's quite bare, but it'll change as soon as I grasp some JavaScript. 
  Clock script operational.
  Gallery operational, but not as I imagined it. Needs rework.
  Code looks awful.
  Sticky menu added and working!
  
# Day 14 - 9.05.2020
Expandable menu added to list ,,Poradniki" and media links. Working well.

# Day 15 - 15.05.2020
Made ,,Log in" and ,,Sign in" buttons instead of a form - this process is going to be located on another subsite when the database is set up properly.
Changed the background a bit, just to make it more fancy.
Added a shop subsite for further database practice when the time comes.
