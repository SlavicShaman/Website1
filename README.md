My webdevelopment learning process

# Day 1
Woohoo, here we go!
HTML structure set up, some essential CSS code added. First JS script written - a clock with the current date.

# Day 3
New JS script added - a slideshow with tank pictures. Not working, sadly.

# Day 5 
Tank slideshow still not operational. First attempt to set up a localhost server using XAMPP and implement some simple php code.
Server set up and working without any fatal issues.
